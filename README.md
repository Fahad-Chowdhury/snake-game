# **Snake Game**
## About
This project is a mini-game developed in Python, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Turtle module. Snake is regarded as a game of skill that has captivated players for generations. The snake is maneuvered using four directional buttons, guiding it based on its current heading. The player’s goal is to score as many points as possible by collecting food. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Game Instructions:
Guide the snake using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to gather food. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and you earn a point. Be cautious—the game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.
